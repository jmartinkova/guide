Knowledge Model Editor Tutorial
*******************************

This Knowledge Model Editor Tutorial will help you to create your own Knowledge Model step by step.

----

The KM (Knowledge Model) Editor is used for creating and updating Knowledge Models. This tutorial will go through the steps of creating a new KM from scratch.

Create a new Knowledge Model
============================

1. Click on **Knowledge Models** and then on **Editors** in Sidebar
2. Click on **Create** in the top right corner
3. Fill the fields with appropriate Name (e.g. ``KM Editor Test Model``) and Knowledge Model ID (e.g. ``test-model``). The ID can contain alphanumeric characters and dash but cannot start or end with dash. Leave Parent Knowledge Model as is (–). Note: If you want to update or reuse an existing model, this is where you select which one.
4. Click on **Create** button

Create a Chapter
================

Once you have created a new KM, it’s time to fill it with Chapters (i.e. sections; think of them as headers of your model).

1. Press **+ Add chapter**
2. Write a Title (e.g. ``Introduction``) and Text (e.g. ``Background information``) for the chapter. Note: The Text field is where you add a description of what the chapter will contain questions about. There are two tabs, **Editor** and **Preview**, since you can use :doc:`../../../miscellaneous/markdown` to format the text and check the result in **Preview**.
3. Press **+ Add question** in order to create a Question

Notice another Sidebar that gives an overview of your KM. Use this to navigate between the different parts. Whenever you want to see the result of an addition, click on another part in the KM overview (at this stage this would be the *parent* we named `My test KM`.

You can also Expand and Collapse parts of your KM to get better overview.

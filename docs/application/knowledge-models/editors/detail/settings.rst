In the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, we can change knowledge model's **Name** and **Knowledge Model ID**. The knowledge model ID is used for the identification together with the :ref:`organization ID<organization-settings>` and knowledge model version after it is published. So the identifier of the knolwedge model is: 

.. code::

    <organizationId>:<knowledgeModelId>:<version>


If the knowledge model was based on another knowledge model, we can also see the **Parent Knowledge Model** in the settings.

In the **Danger Zone** we can delete the knowledge model. Once it is deleted it can **no longer be recovered**.

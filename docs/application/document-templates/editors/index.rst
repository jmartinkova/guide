Document Template Editors
*************************

On this page, we can see a list of all document template editors. Everyone with the data steward role assigned can see all the document template editors and use them.

    figure


We can use the search field to search for a specific document template editor. The editors are sorted by when they were last updated but we can change that.

We can :doc:`./create` by clicking the :guilabel:`Create` button.

By clicking the triple dots on each of the item in the list we can access some actions:

- **Open Editor** - simply open the :doc:`./detail/index` (we can also click the name of the editor)
- **Delete** - to delete the document template editor (cannot be undone)

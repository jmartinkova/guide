Project Importers Development
*****************************

.. WARNING::

    Project importers are an experimental feature.

Project importers are can be used to import the data from an external resource to DSW questionnaire. The importer creates the replies based on the data, therefore it needs to know the structure of the knowledge model it is compatible with.

We can implement a project importer using `DSW Importer SDK <https://github.com/ds-wizard/dsw-importer-sdk>`_. It is a JavaScript library we can import and use its API for the communication with DSW. The installation and usage is described in the SDK readme.

Example Importers
=================

There are some importers already implemented. They are a good resource to see how to use the SDK:


- `DSW Replies Importer <https://github.com/ds-wizard/dsw-replies-importer>`_
- `DSW maDMP Importer <https://github.com/ds-wizard/dsw-madmp-importer>`_

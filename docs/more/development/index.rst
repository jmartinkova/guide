Development
***********

DSW can be extended in many ways and new components and ways of integrations can be developed to support our needs. Besides the API available for everything that can be done in DSW, new :ref:`integrations <integrations>` and :ref:`project importers<development-importers>` can be implementet to get data from outside to DSW, or new :ref:`document templates<document-template-development>` and :ref:`submission services<submission-service>` can be created to get the data outside of DSW in the desired form.

This section provides information on how to develop custom content for DSW to fully tailor the tool to our specific requirements.
